/**
 * Only accept log requests within a dedicated thread.
 * <p>
 * This is for example suitable in a scenario where a log should be associated
 * with a functor object but the functor is executed in different worker
 * threads. If the functor activates its filter upon entry, all activities can
 * be sent to the same log, even from different workers. In this case the thread
 * associated with the filter is switched with "activate" and "deactivate".
 * These methods should always be used in a "finally" style block.
 * <p>
 * Another scenario is where a thread has a dedicated task and all its
 * activities have to be logged. Here the thread is associated at startup and
 * remains the same.
