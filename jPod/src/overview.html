<h2><a name="Installation">Installation</a></h2>
To use this implementation, you have to include the jar files in the "lib" directory in your classpath.

<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>
This is the "kernel" of the intarsys PDF implementation, containing the static model
parts, datatypes and IO implementations. Using this kernel alone, you are
able to read, manipulate and write PDF documents in any way you like. An 
impressive example is CABAReT Stage, built completely on top of this kernel.

A couple of other layers and libraries will provide 
additional features to ease PDF document handling. 

Here is a (incomplete) <b>Feature List</b> for this implementation:

<ul>
<li>Lazy reading</li>
<li>Incremental writing</li>
<li>Update propagation</li>
<li>Hooks for undo support</li>
<li>Strict constraints on internal COSObject consistency</li>
<li>Rich PD level</li>
<li>Additional higher level features (rendering etc.) available</li>
<li>Professional references (e.g. CABAReT Stage)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Factories</h3>
A factory decouples semantics from concrete implementation. Our factories use
always an interface using the name "I[name]Factory". A singleton implementation
with the name "[name]Factory" provides getter and setter to access this factory.
In most cases a standard implementation is provided, named 
"Standard[name]Factory".
